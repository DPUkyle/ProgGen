Gosu project to do AppleScript codegen.

Goal is to script the generation of EyeTV schedules data-driven by screen-scraped content.

2014 addendum:
When screen-scraping the schedule, the Date and Time columns needed special formatting.  I pasted each excel column individually into Sublime Text.

Date:
Using Sublime Text's multiple line edit feature, it was easy to put ", 2014" at the end of each date value.

Time:
Also using the multiple line edit, add seconds to each time so all end with :SS
Finally, use this regex-replace to ensure all hour values have a leading zero:
Match:      ^(\d\:)
Replace:    0\1
