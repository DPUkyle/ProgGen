~~Gosu~~ Java 8 project to do AppleScript codegen.

Goal is to script the generation of EyeTV schedules using screen-scraped content via [jsoup](http://jsoup.org/).

2015 addendum:
I changed to Java for these reasons:
* Learn the new Java 8 Date API
* TZ conversion was giving me major headaches in applescript
* Use a proper Gradle build
* Tests!
* jsoup library - forget Excel!
